Description: Enables the evaluation of diffusion distances for complex single-layer networks.
    Given a network one can define different types of Laplacian (or transition)
    matrices corresponding to different continuous-time random walks dynamics on the network.
    This package enables the evaluation of Laplacians, stochastic matrices, and the
    corresponding diffusion distance matrices. The metric structure induced by the network-driven
    process is richer and more robust than the one given by shortest-paths and allows to study
    the geometry induced by different types of diffusion-like communication mechanisms taking
    place on complex networks.
